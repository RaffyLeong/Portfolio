            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Ka Fong Leong (Raffy) </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Macau, China.</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            I’m a passionate developer with a keen interest in both front-end and back-end technologies. 
            I love creating engaging user experiences and building seamless applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            Throughout my learning journey, I’ve developed a social app, an e-commerce platform, and a simple chat application. 
            These projects allowed me to explore various technologies and design principles, and I’m excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic team.
            <br />

          </p>
